                <p class="text-grey">
                As part of an effort consistent with its commercial strategy and in line with actions to expand its 
                presence in the global banana market, Grupo Esfuerzo launched its new website this July. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                    <cite class="font-italic text-grey">
                    "We want to offer a new communication channel and a point of contact with our customers in North America,
                    Europe and Asia by creating a user-friendly website, that is accessible and contains valuable information 
                    in 3 languages: Spanish, English and German " 
                    </cite>, said Roberto Gomez, general manager of the company.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                This webpage will also serve to increase the confidence of potential buyers abroad and to 
                publicize the latest news about the Costa Rican business group.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                    <cite class="fotn-italic text-grey">
                    "In the future, we want to diversify our production, for example, and this site will help us 
                    communicate to the world what we have to offer"
                    </cite>, said Jaime Gómez, company director. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                The site is also a tool for transparency and accountability as part of Grupo Esfuerzo's 
                Corporate Social Responsibility strategy.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                For this reason, the consulting company in charge of developing the project was Vanguart Agency,
                 a firm with more than 12 years of experience in CSR and sustainability communication. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                    <cite class="font-italic text-grey">
                    "In building this website, we wanted to reflect the essence of Grupo Esfuerzo, its philosophy of doing triple-impact business and its contribution to the country"
                    </cite>, stated Laura Villalobos, CEO of Vanguart Agency.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                Villalobos also explained that 
                    <cite class="font-italic text-grey">
                    "it was a wonderful experience to realize that there are socially and environmentally responsible family 
                    businesses that go the extra mile, managing their impacts and prioritizing the well-being of their employees, 
                    their families and communities. It has been an honor to work with the Gómez family and Grupo Esfuerzo.”
                    </cite>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                In fact, one of the greatest virtues of the website is a robust Sustainability section that sets out, in detail, 
                all of the actions implemented by the company in terms of Governance, Environmental and Social, and their 
                contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established in the United Nations 
                2030 Agenda. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                Grupo Esfuerzo specifically works for SDGs 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15 and 17, which are related to quality education, 
                adequate housing, decent work and economic growth, sustainable communities, responsible production and the protection
                 of biodiversity and terrestrial ecosystems. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                    Finally, the site will also compile and document the success story of Grupo
                     Esfuerzo starting in 1989, when Eduardo Gómez acquired the first farm, until
                     today when they export 1.6 million boxes per year to more than 6 countries and employ
                     around 500 local people. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                    <cite class="font-italic text-grey">
                    "Through the website, we will honor the values instilled in us by our founder,
                    a leader and an example of perseverance, service and effort"
                    </cite>, the company's Manager proudly assured, as he contemplated the launch of the new 
                    website that is now available to all those interested in doing business with Grupo Esfuerzo.
