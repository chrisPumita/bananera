                Grupo Esfuerzo is a Costa Rican owned company with more than 30 
                years of experience exporting bananas of excellent quality and 
                following the best ethical and sustainable production practices.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                We were first established as Bananera El Esfuerzo in 1988, 
                with the development of a farm in 28 Millas de Matina, in 
                Limón, Costa Rica.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                Since then, we have expanded our production area from one farm to four 
                for a total of 960 hectares, and export to North America, Caribbean,
                Europe, Middle East and Asia. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                Each year we sell an average of 1.6 million cases, which is equivalent 
                to 1.5% of the Costa Rican market, thus impacting the local economy and 
                contributing to building the country's brand worldwide.

                We all dream of devoting our lives to doing what we love; to make 
                an impact on the world and leave a legacy. That is why many people
                decide to start their own business, but few, like Mr. Eduardo Gómez,
                 are able to turn it into a successful, internationally recognized 
                 and sustainable business group for more than 30 years, and counting...
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                Without a doubt, this visionary has dedicated his entire life to 
                bananas. He began as a young boy, in 1948, as a messenger in the 
                accounting office of the Chiquita Brands company where his father 
                worked.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                From that humble job, he devoted his free time studying accounting 
                and obtaining his high school diploma through correspondence. While 
                other boys his age were playing soccer or riding bicycles, Eduardo 
                was already preparing for a career in finance, administration and 
                even information technology, positions he performed efficiently, with 
                excellence and effort during his 40 years working at Chiquita.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                    ¿Can you picture him, young and slim, dreaming of exporting
                    his own brand of bananas to the rest of the world?
                    For this reason, Eduardo Gómez decided, long before starting his 
                    business, that he would name his dream company El Esfuerzo "to 
                    reflect the effort that it took to have something of his own after 
                    being an employee of a banana company for many years". 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                That is how in 1988 he bought the first 230 hectares in 28 Millas 
                de Bataán de Matina. Two years later he invested all of his life 
                savings and secured a bank loan that would turn him into a businessman, 
                even mortgaging his own house in the process.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col podcast">
                <p class="text-grey">
                But El Esfuerzo would not become a real company until, as it 
                happens with the best corporate leaders in the world, it faced 
                its first crisis...
                On April 22, 1991, an earthquake measuring no less than a shocking 
                7.7 on the seismological moment magnitude scale struck Costa Rica 
                and the border area of Panama.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                This seismic event almost completely destroyed everything that had 
                been accomplished by El Esfuerzo and plunged the province of Limón 
                into a gloomy atmosphere of anguish, meanwhile the news reported dozens 
                of deaths and injuries. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                ow do you overcome an event like this when you are just starting out? 
                How do you not give up? Well, by doing what Mr Eduardo knows best, 
                giving his best effort. His motivation? To build a legacy for his 
                family and make a contribution to the country... 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                That effort, together with reliability, commitment, quality and social
                and environmental responsibility are the values that mark his leadership 
                to this day, both as a businessman and as a member of the Board of 
                Directors of Corporación Bananera Nacional (CORBANA). 
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                These are also the values he instilled in his son Jaime and 
                his grandson Roberto, who now share the management of the company.
                </p>
                <p class="text-grey">
                Together with all of the people who make up El Esfuerzo, they have embraced 
                this philosophy through a Corporate Social Responsibility strategy that 
                began long before the United Nations designed its 2030 agenda, which also
                 seeks to guarantee proper housing, access to education and health, and 
                 care for the environment.
